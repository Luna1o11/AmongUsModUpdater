## Installation

1. Download and unzip the [AmongUsModUpdater.zip](https://github.com/Narua2010/AmongUsModUpdater/releases/download/v2.1.0/AmongUsModUpdater.zip).
2. Unzip the folder wherever you want.
3. Run the setup.exe. Instead of setup.exe, AmongUsModUpdater.exe can also be executed directly. In this case, however, .NET5 must be installed manually. This will be pointed out during execution and you will be redirected accordingly.
4. The program is then started each time via AmongUsModUpdater.exe.
